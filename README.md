# RAG Agent Development

## Current State of Things

- The RAG agent is up and running with basic functionality.
- Activity monitoring and categorization are implemented and working.
- Machine learning integration has been initiated for advanced insights and predictions.
- A basic dashboard has been created for visualizing activity data.
- The project structure has been updated to support future enhancements.

## Hardware Requirements

- CPU: Dual-core processor (2.0 GHz or higher)
- RAM: 4 GB minimum, 8 GB recommended
- Storage: 1 GB of free disk space for the application and data storage
- Internet connection for sending notifications and accessing external services (if configured)

## Goals

### Short-term Goals (1-3 months)
- Refine and optimize the machine learning models for activity categorization and privacy classification.
- Implement real-time anomaly detection for unusual activity patterns.
- Enhance the dashboard with interactive visualizations and customizable reports.
- Develop a RESTful API for third-party integrations and extensions.
- Implement automated testing for all core components and plugins.
- Create a user-friendly configuration interface for easy customization of the RAG agent.

### Mid-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Implement a sophisticated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using state-of-the-art language models.
- Integrate FAISS or Annoy for efficient similarity search and information retrieval.
- Develop an advanced data preprocessing pipeline with adaptive text cleaning and intelligent chunking.
- Implement a hybrid approach combining local language models with cloud-based services for optimal performance and privacy.
- Create an intelligent caching system with predictive prefetching for improved response times.
- Enhance `project_assistant.py` with natural language understanding for more context-aware project analysis.
- Develop a comprehensive visualization suite in `visualize.py` for in-depth productivity analytics and trend forecasting.

### Long-term Goals (6-12 months)
- Implement a fully modular and extensible architecture supporting plug-and-play components for databases, embeddings, and language models.
- Develop an AI-driven feedback loop for continuous self-improvement and adaptation of the RAG agent.
- Create a version control system within the `evolution/` directory for tracking and analyzing the agent's development over time.
- Enhance `code_reviewer.py` with deep learning models for advanced code analysis, including security vulnerability detection and performance optimization suggestions.
- Develop a decentralized plugin marketplace with automated quality checks and user ratings.
- Implement advanced NLP capabilities in `nl_config.py` for conversational configuration and natural language commands.
- Integrate cutting-edge machine learning models for predictive task scheduling and adaptive workflow optimization.

## Decisions Log

- Decided to implement the RAG agent in Python.
- Decided to use the subprocess module to start the activity monitor script in the background.
- Decided to integrate machine learning capabilities for advanced insights and predictions.
- Decided to implement a plugin system for extensibility.
- Decided to use a dashboard for real-time visualization of activity data and insights.

## Open Questions

- How can we further improve the accuracy of activity categorization and project association?
- What additional features would be most beneficial for users in the dashboard?
- How can we ensure user privacy while still providing valuable insights?
- What are the most effective ways to train and update our machine learning models in production?
- How can we make the RAG agent more adaptable to different work environments and user preferences?
