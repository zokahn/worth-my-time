# RAG Agent Development

## Current State of Things

- The RAG agent is up and running with basic functionality.
- Activity monitoring and categorization are implemented and working.
- Machine learning integration has been initiated for advanced insights and predictions.
- A basic dashboard has been created for visualizing activity data.
- The project structure has been updated to support future enhancements.

## Hardware Requirements

- CPU: Dual-core processor (2.0 GHz or higher)
- RAM: 4 GB minimum, 8 GB recommended
- Storage: 1 GB of free disk space for the application and data storage
- Internet connection for sending notifications and accessing external services (if configured)

## Goals

### Short-term Goals (1-3 months)
- Implement advanced natural language processing for more accurate activity categorization and privacy classification.
- Develop a real-time anomaly detection system using unsupervised learning algorithms.
- Create an interactive, customizable dashboard with data visualization libraries like D3.js or Plotly.
- Design and implement a comprehensive RESTful API with OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure third-party integrations.
- Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with automated testing for all components.
- Develop a graphical user interface for configuration management, supporting both local and remote configurations.

### Mid-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Implement a state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using models like GPT-4 or PaLM.
- Integrate vector databases (e.g., Pinecone or Weaviate) for efficient similarity search and information retrieval.
- Develop an intelligent data preprocessing pipeline with adaptive cleaning, smart chunking, and automatic metadata extraction.
- Create a hybrid architecture combining edge computing with cloud services for optimal performance, privacy, and scalability.
- Implement an advanced caching system with predictive prefetching and intelligent cache invalidation strategies.
- Enhance `project_assistant.py` with multi-modal understanding (text, code, and diagrams) for comprehensive project analysis.
- Develop an AI-powered productivity analytics suite with predictive modeling and personalized recommendations.

### Long-term Goals (6-12 months)
- Design a fully modular, microservices-based architecture with dynamic scaling and fault tolerance.
- Implement a self-evolving AI system capable of generating and testing its own improvements.
- Develop a distributed version control system for tracking and analyzing the agent's evolution across multiple instances.
- Create an AI-driven code analysis and optimization tool with vulnerability detection, performance tuning, and automatic refactoring suggestions.
- Build a decentralized, blockchain-based plugin marketplace with smart contracts for licensing and automatic revenue sharing.
- Implement a multi-modal interface supporting voice commands, gesture control, and augmented reality for seamless interaction.
- Develop a predictive project management system with AI-driven resource allocation, risk assessment, and timeline optimization.

## Decisions Log

- Decided to implement the RAG agent in Python.
- Decided to use the subprocess module to start the activity monitor script in the background.
- Decided to integrate machine learning capabilities for advanced insights and predictions.
- Decided to implement a plugin system for extensibility.
- Decided to use a dashboard for real-time visualization of activity data and insights.

## Open Questions

- How can we further improve the accuracy of activity categorization and project association?
- What additional features would be most beneficial for users in the dashboard?
- How can we ensure user privacy while still providing valuable insights?
- What are the most effective ways to train and update our machine learning models in production?
- How can we make the RAG agent more adaptable to different work environments and user preferences?
