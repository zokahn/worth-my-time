# RAG Agent Development

## Current State of Things

- The RAG agent is up and running with basic functionality.
- Activity monitoring and categorization are implemented and working.
- Machine learning integration has been initiated for advanced insights and predictions.
- A basic dashboard has been created for visualizing activity data.
- The project structure has been updated to support future enhancements.

## Hardware Requirements

- CPU: Dual-core processor (2.0 GHz or higher)
- RAM: 4 GB minimum, 8 GB recommended
- Storage: 1 GB of free disk space for the application and data storage
- Internet connection for sending notifications and accessing external services (if configured)

## Goals

### Short-term Goals (1-3 months)
- Enhance the activity categorization system with machine learning capabilities.
- Implement privacy classification for activities (business vs. personal).
- Improve the dashboard with real-time activity predictions and model performance metrics.
- Develop and integrate more plugins for extended functionality.
- Implement a robust error handling and notification system.

### Mid-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Implement a cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent.
- Use FAISS or Annoy for efficient similarity search in the RAG system.
- Implement a data preprocessing pipeline with text cleaning, tokenization, and chunking.
- Integrate a lightweight local language model like GPT4All or LLaMA for the generation part.
- Implement a caching mechanism for generated responses to improve performance.
- Enhance `project_assistant.py` to provide more insightful analysis of status files.
- Improve `visualize.py` to generate more comprehensive visual representations of project progress and health.

### Long-term Goals (6-12 months)
- Implement a modular architecture allowing for easy swapping of vector databases, embedding models, and language models.
- Develop a sophisticated feedback loop for self-analysis and continuous improvement of the RAG agent.
- Expand the `evolution/` directory to store and analyze historical versions of key components.
- Enhance `code_reviewer.py` to perform more advanced AI-assisted code reviews and integrate it fully into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Develop an advanced plugin ecosystem with a marketplace for third-party plugins.
- Implement advanced natural language processing in `nl_config.py` for more intuitive configuration of the RAG agent.
- Integrate advanced machine learning models for predictive analytics and anomaly detection in user activities.

## Decisions Log

- Decided to implement the RAG agent in Python.
- Decided to use the subprocess module to start the activity monitor script in the background.
- Decided to integrate machine learning capabilities for advanced insights and predictions.
- Decided to implement a plugin system for extensibility.
- Decided to use a dashboard for real-time visualization of activity data and insights.

## Open Questions

- How can we further improve the accuracy of activity categorization and project association?
- What additional features would be most beneficial for users in the dashboard?
- How can we ensure user privacy while still providing valuable insights?
- What are the most effective ways to train and update our machine learning models in production?
- How can we make the RAG agent more adaptable to different work environments and user preferences?
