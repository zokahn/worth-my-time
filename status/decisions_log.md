# Decisions Log

- Decided to implement the RAG agent in Python for its extensive libraries and community support.
- Decided to use the subprocess module to start the activity monitor script in the background for improved performance and modularity.
- Decided to add the current directory to the Python path to resolve the ModuleNotFoundError and ensure proper module imports.
- Decided to integrate machine learning capabilities (ActivityPredictor and PrivacyClassifier) for advanced insights and predictions.
- Decided to implement a plugin system for extensibility and easier integration of new features.
- Decided to use a dashboard for real-time visualization of activity data and insights, improving user experience and data interpretation.
- Decided to implement separate configuration files for different environments (dev, prod) to facilitate easier deployment and testing.
- Decided to use a pipeline architecture for the machine learning models to streamline data processing and prediction.
- Decided to implement robust error handling and logging mechanisms to improve system reliability and debugging capabilities.
- Decided to create detailed installation instructions (INSTALL.md) to facilitate easier setup for new users and contributors.
- Decided to implement privacy classification to ensure user data protection and compliance with privacy regulations.
- Decided to use TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes classification for text categorization when training data is available.
