# Goals

## Short-term Goals (1-3 months)
- Enhance the activity categorization system with machine learning capabilities.
- Implement privacy classification for activities (business vs. personal).
- Improve the dashboard with real-time activity predictions and model performance metrics.
- Develop and integrate more plugins for extended functionality.
- Implement a robust error handling and notification system.

## Mid-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Implement a cutting-edge Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent.
- Use FAISS or Annoy for efficient similarity search in the RAG system.
- Implement a data preprocessing pipeline with text cleaning, tokenization, and chunking.
- Integrate a lightweight local language model like GPT4All or LLaMA for the generation part.
- Implement a caching mechanism for generated responses to improve performance.
- Enhance `project_assistant.py` to provide more insightful analysis of status files.
- Improve `visualize.py` to generate more comprehensive visual representations of project progress and health.

## Long-term Goals (6-12 months)
- Implement a modular architecture allowing for easy swapping of vector databases, embedding models, and language models.
- Develop a sophisticated feedback loop for self-analysis and continuous improvement of the RAG agent.
- Expand the `evolution/` directory to store and analyze historical versions of key components.
- Enhance `code_reviewer.py` to perform more advanced AI-assisted code reviews and integrate it fully into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Develop an advanced plugin ecosystem with a marketplace for third-party plugins.
- Implement advanced natural language processing in `nl_config.py` for more intuitive configuration of the RAG agent.
- Integrate advanced machine learning models for predictive analytics and anomaly detection in user activities.

## Ongoing Goals
- Continuously improve the accuracy and efficiency of activity tracking and categorization.
- Regularly update and maintain all components of the system.
- Ensure robust security and privacy measures are in place and up-to-date.
- Gather and incorporate user feedback for continuous improvement of the RAG agent's functionality and user experience.
