# Goals

## Short-term Goals (1-3 months)
- Enhance the natural language processing capabilities for even more accurate activity categorization and privacy classification.
- Implement a real-time anomaly detection system using unsupervised learning algorithms to identify unusual patterns in user activities.
- Expand the dashboard functionality with more interactive and customizable visualizations using D3.js or Plotly.
- Design and implement a comprehensive RESTful API with OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure third-party integrations.
- Complete the setup of a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline with automated testing for all components.
- Develop a user-friendly graphical interface for configuration management, supporting both local and remote configurations.
- Implement automated model retraining and updating based on new activity data.

## Mid-term Goals (3-6 months)
- Integrate a state-of-the-art Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using models like GPT-4 or PaLM for more advanced insights and recommendations.
- Implement vector databases (e.g., Pinecone or Weaviate) for efficient similarity search and information retrieval in large activity datasets.
- Develop an intelligent data preprocessing pipeline with adaptive cleaning, smart chunking, and automatic metadata extraction to improve data quality.
- Create a hybrid architecture combining edge computing with cloud services for optimal performance, privacy, and scalability.
- Implement an advanced caching system with predictive prefetching and intelligent cache invalidation strategies to improve response times.
- Enhance `project_assistant.py` with multi-modal understanding (text, code, and diagrams) for more comprehensive project analysis.
- Develop an AI-powered productivity analytics suite with predictive modeling and personalized recommendations based on user activity patterns.

## Long-term Goals (6-12 months)
- Design and implement a fully modular, microservices-based architecture with dynamic scaling and fault tolerance for improved reliability and performance.
- Develop a self-evolving AI system capable of generating and testing its own improvements to the RAG agent's functionality.
- Implement a distributed version control system for tracking and analyzing the agent's evolution across multiple instances and deployments.
- Create an AI-driven code analysis and optimization tool with vulnerability detection, performance tuning, and automatic refactoring suggestions for the RAG agent's codebase.
- Build a decentralized, blockchain-based plugin marketplace with smart contracts for licensing and automatic revenue sharing to foster community contributions.
- Implement a multi-modal interface supporting voice commands, gesture control, and augmented reality for more intuitive and seamless interaction with the RAG agent.
- Develop a predictive project management system with AI-driven resource allocation, risk assessment, and timeline optimization based on historical activity data and project patterns.

## Ongoing Goals
- Continuously improve the accuracy and efficiency of activity tracking and categorization through regular model updates and data analysis.
- Maintain and enhance the robust security framework with regular audits and updates to protect user privacy and data integrity.
- Actively engage with the user community to gather feedback, address concerns, and prioritize feature development.
- Stay updated with the latest advancements in AI and machine learning to incorporate cutting-edge technologies and methodologies into the RAG agent.
